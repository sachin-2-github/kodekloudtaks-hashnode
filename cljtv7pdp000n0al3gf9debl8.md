## Problem:

> A developer kirsty has been assigned `Nautilus` project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for kirsty. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.
> 
> Therefore, create a user named `kirsty` on the `App Server 2`. Set `expiry date` to `2021-01-28` in `Stratos Datacenter`. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

## Solution:

1. ssh into the app-server2
    
2. To create `kirsty` user with an expiry date, execute the following command.
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo useradd -e 2021-01-28 kirsty
    ```
