## Problem:

> The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:
> 
> a. Create a docker network named as `beta` on App Server `2` in `Stratos DC`.
> 
> b. Configure it to use `macvlan` drivers.
> 
> c. Set it to use subnet `172.28.0.0/24` and iprange `172.28.0.2/24`.

## Solution:

*<mark>Please ensure to review the task instructions carefully and modify the commands according to your specific server, username, and other relevant details.</mark>*

1. ssh into `app-server2`
    
2. Create a docker network named "`beta`" with the `macvlan` driver using the following command:
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo docker network create --driver macvlan --subnet=192.168.0.0/24 --ip-range=192.168.0.2/24 beta
    ```
    
    This command creates a docker network named "`beta`" and configures it to use the `macvlan` driver with the specified `subnet` and `IP` range.
    
3. Verify that the "`beta`" network has been successfully created by running the command:
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo docker network ls
    ```
    
    This command lists all the docker networks on the server, and you should see the "`beta`" network in the list.
