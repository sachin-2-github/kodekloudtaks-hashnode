### Problem:

> In response to heightened security concerns, the `xFusionCorp Industries` security team has opted for custom Apache users for their web applications. Each user is tailored specifically for an application, enhancing security measures. Your task is to create a custom Apache user according to the outlined specifications:
> 
> a. Create a user named `rose` on `App server 2` within the Stratos Datacenter.
> 
> b. Assign a unique UID `1990` and designate the home directory as `/var/www/rose`.

*<mark>Please ensure to review the task instructions carefully and modify the commands according to your specific server, username, and other relevant details.</mark>*

### Solution:

1. ssh into the app server 2
    
2. Use below command
    
    ```plaintext
     sudo useradd -u 1990 -d /var/www/rose -m rose
    ```
    
    * Breakdown of the command:
        
        * `-u 1990`: Sets the UID to 1990.
            
        * `-d /var/www/rose`: Sets the home directory to `/var/www/rose`.
            
        * `-m`: Creates the home directory if it does not exist.
            
        * `rose`: The username to be created.
            
3. Check if the user is created or not `cat /etc/passwd | grep rose` You should see the entry for `rose` user in `passwd` file
