## Problem:

> We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.
> 
>   
> 
> On `storage server` in `Stratos Datacenter` we have private and public keys stored `/home/*_key.asc`. Use those keys to perform the following actions.
> 
> * Encrypt `/home/encrypt_me.txt` to `/home/encrypted_me.asc`.
>     
> * Decrypt `/home/decrypt_me.asc` to `/home/decrypted_me.txt`. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is `kodekloud`).
